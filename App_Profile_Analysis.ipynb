    "In this project, I was attempting to give a app profile recommendation for a company that makes free apps for english speaker and plans to profit from in app advertising. We collected data from the two largest app stores, the App Store and Google Play. We cleaned the data to remove an errors or unrelated data before finally analyzing the data. We found that a popular section of both markets is the social market.
